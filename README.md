# Workforce Analytics with DAX in Power BI

This project is a detailed demonstration of workforce analytics using Power BI with a star schema data model. 
It includes four dimension tables and one fact table. 
Using DAX functions, I derived actionable insights, KPIs, and visualizations for HR and operational decision-making.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Problems & DAX Solutions

### 1. **Average Work Hours Per Department**
```dax
AvgWorkHoursPerDept = 
AVERAGEX(
    VALUES(DimDepartment[DepartmentName]),
    CALCULATE(SUM(FactEmployeePerformance[WorkHours]))
)
```


EfficiencyScore = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(FactEmployeePerformance[TasksCompleted]),
    SUM(FactEmployeePerformance[WorkHours])
)
